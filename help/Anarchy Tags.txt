HGO includes some simple releasable nations to represent areas without a government.
If you want more than 1 type of these tags, use the "civilwar communism" console command while playing as them to get an extra nation.
By default, the nations are AuthRep. The other ideologies provide some minor alternatives, with a suggested description of what they mean/should be used for, 
although its really up to you. The ideology and name may not necessarily line up in all cases, so its recommended that you just go by the name.
These tags have cores on the "Watermark" state, which a state in the ocean south of Sri Lanka. The state is shapped like "HGO". Use toolpack to release them.
